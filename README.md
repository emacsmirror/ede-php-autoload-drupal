# ede-php-autolaod-drupal

## Description

This project adds support for [Drupal][] 8+ to [ede-php-autoload][].

Supplies ede-php-autoload with information on the classes located
in modules in a Drupal project. All modules found in `core/modules`,
`modules`, `profiles/<profile>/modules` and `sites/<sites, including
default and all>/modules` is added.

As Drupal uses [composer/installers][],
[ede-php-autoload-composer-installers][] is required for practical use.
